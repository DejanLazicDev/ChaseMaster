Switching remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH
---------------------------------------

A common mistake is cloning using the default (HTTPS) instead of SSH. 
You can correct this by going to your repository, clicking "Clone or download", then clicking the "Use SSH" button above the URL field and updating the URL of your origin remote like this:

List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change:

git remote -v

Change your remote's URL from HTTPS to SSH with the git remote set-url command:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:DejanLazicDev/ChaseMaster.git
